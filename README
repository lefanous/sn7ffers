## Objective:

Use Scapy to sniff the packets arriving at a network interface. After each packet is
captured, process it using a callback function to get useful information from it.

## Algorithm:

This script captures packets, tracks attempts a source IP makes to reach a specific destination IP and port,
and continuously displays this information on the screen. It checks for SYN-ACK or RST TCP flags to
determine if the port is open or closed.

## How to:

1. Import the file into your virtual machine,
2. Open your terminal, cd to the directory containing the source code
3. Run command: $chmod +x <file>, to make the file executable
4. Run the script with the following command: $sudo ./<file>
5. Use another/parallel terminal to run your scan as usual. The result should appear in the other terminal ;-)

## Note:

Feel free to add to this script. I haven't really made it robust, with error handling yet.
